I'm a software engineer based in Seattle, WA. I grew up in Mililani/Wahiawa, Hawaii and lived my most recent years overseas with the United States Air Force. While serving 6 years in the military, I graduated from [UMGC](https://www.umgc.edu/academic-programs/bachelors-degrees/software-development-and-security.cfm) with Bachelor's of Science in Software Development and (Application) Security; with a Minor in Cybersecurity.

I spend most of my software development time doing research and building understanding, then roll out implementations for my own use cases.

## What I do for work now [#](#what-i-do-for-work-now)

I provide teaching assistance in a couple of Computer Science courses (C# and HTML/CSS/JS) with [SMU](https://www.stmartin.edu/academics/programs-schools/hal-and-inge-marcus-school-engineering/areas-of-study/microsoft-software-and-systems-academy), and train every month as a SOC analyst with the Washington Air National Guard.

## Why this website? [#](#why-this-website)

I wanted to learn how to build a website with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) because it's a [relevant](https://nextjs.org/showcase) (React) framework for web development, and it provides me [hybrid rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) options should this scale beyond statically generated content.

It also serves as motivation for me to start writing about stuff I like (tech and non-tech) and to continue creating projects to showcase here.
