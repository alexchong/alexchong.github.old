{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"About Me","description":"About Me"},"page":{"content":"\nI'm a software engineer based in Seattle, WA. I grew up in Mililani/Wahiawa, Hawaii and spent the last five years overseas, serving with the United States Air Force (a story for another blog post ðŸ˜Ž)\n\n## What are you all about? [#](#what-are-you-all-about)\n\nI graduated from [UMGC](https://www.umgc.edu/academic-programs/bachelors-degrees/software-development-and-security.cfm) and studied Software Development and (Application) Security; with a Minor in Cybersecurity.\n\nIn the past, I've worked on anything from general-purpose applications (Java; C#), automated scripts (Python; Bash), to web interfaces (React; HTML/CSS/JavaScript)\n\nCurrently, I spend most of my software development time doing research and building understanding around web and scripting technologies, then roll out passion implementations for my own use cases.\n\n## What are you enthusiastic for? [#](#what-are-you-enthusiastic-for)\n\nI care about purpose-driven work, and have a concern for achieving the perfect combination of accesibility and security for user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX).\n\n## Why build this website? [#](#why-build-this-website)\n\nI wanted to learn how to build a website with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) because it's a [relevant](https://nextjs.org/showcase) (React) framework for web development, and it provides me [hybrid rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) options should this scale beyond statically generated content.\n\nIt also serves as motivation for me to write about random stuff I like (tech and non-tech), and to showcase my projects. Find out more about my overall goal in my [first blog post](/post/telegraphing-competence).\n\n## Contact me [#](#contact-me)\n\nYou can reach out to me at [alex.b.chong@outlook.com](mailto:alex.b.chong@outlook.com) if you want to connect.
