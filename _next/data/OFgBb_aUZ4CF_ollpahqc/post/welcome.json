But I was missing out.\n\n[Josh Thompson](https://josh.works/remote-job-resources#telegraphing-competence) best said it in his humble writing beginnings, that telegraphing competence showed:\n\n> - I have some initiative. Not necessarily a lot, but at least a little\n> - I can write words in a legible and readable fashion. This is valuable in a remote work environment, as almost all communication will be written. (I.E. writing skills are particularly valuable.)\n\nIn this regard, I finally agree.\n\n## Next steps\n\nOver the course of time I want primarily to use this space to publish anything from writeups to research, around software & web development, and cybersecurity. In addition, I would like to write about professional development stuff too. Cheers.\n","excerpt":""},"previousPost":null,"nextPost":null},"__N_SSG":true}
