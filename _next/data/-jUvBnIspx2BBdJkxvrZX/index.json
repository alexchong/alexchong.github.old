But my stance has changed on that since.\n\n[Josh Thompson](https://josh.works/remote-job-resources#telegraphing-competence), a software developer known for his high-profile advices shared around Hacker News, asserts his thoughts on writing for early-career seekers in one of his earlier humble articles in 2019:\n\n> None of \\[my\\] posts are earth shattering (actually, they are _all_ very basic) but it telegraphs:\n>\n> - I have some initiative. Not necessarily a lot, but at least a little\n> - I can write words in a legible and readable fashion. This is valuable in a remote work environment, as almost all communication will be written. (I.E. writing skills are particularly valuable.)\n\nSome of the posts I've seen that he claims as basic, are actually well-written observations around technologies he's new to using. He even writes about stuff like his time [cooking in 36 different kitchens in a year](https://josh.works/what-ive-learned-from-cooking-in-36-kitchens-in-the-last-year).\n\nOverall, seems like a neat way to express my personality both formally and informally; beyond the elevator pitch.\n\n## Next Steps [#](#next-steps)\n\n**I want to use this opportunity to produce content that is helpful and relevant to those that might read it.** Ideally it would be around software/web development and cybersecurity; to include any research findings, guides & tutorials, or any other write-ups I believe would add value to the discussion. In addition, I'd also like to write about non-technology stuff too (like a review for a weightlifting program, or some useful lifehacks).\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
