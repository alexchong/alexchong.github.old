Hi there, welecome! I'm glad to announce the launch of this site.

So what's the deal?

I haven't figured out what I want to write for my first meaningful post yet. But I did want to push out something soon as I could to show this is my actual active website.

**Check out my [About](https://alexchong.github.io/about) me page in the meantime if you want some actual content.**
