After spending much time and energy laying the groundwork, I'm excited to announce that I am finally able to launch this site for my blog and portfolio use.

## Purpose

So my overall goal with this website (to add on to [#why-this-website](about#why-this-website) in my About page) is to help demonstrate my technical and communicative competence through writing.

It was an excuse for the longest time that because [all early-career development portfolios look the same](https://hecklerjim.github.io/generated-portfolio/), I should deviate from creating my own personal site to avoid any semblance of online macaroni art. But I was missing out.

[Josh Thompson](https://josh.works/remote-job-resources#telegraphing-competence) best said it in his humble writing beginnings, that telegraphing competence showed:

> - I have some initiative. Not necessarily a lot, but at least a little
> - I can write words in a legible and readable fashion. This is valuable in a remote work environment, as almost all communication will be written. (I.E. writing skills are particularly valuable.)

In this regard, I finally agree.

## Next steps

Over the course of time I want primarily to use this space to publish anything from writeups to research, around software & web development, and cybersecurity. In addition, I would like to write about professional development stuff too. Cheers.
